NEED TO FINISH

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how math and reading scores compared between differnt schools. It was found that there were unture scores for the 9th grader's math and reading scores are Thomas High School were not valid due to unethical reporting/test taking. These scores were removed and the results of the summaries were recalculated.
